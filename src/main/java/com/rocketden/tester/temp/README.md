### temp directory

This folder holds the temporary code that users submit. Temporary directories
should be created (e.g. `folderXXXXXX/`) which contain the following files:

* `Driverfile.x`: The driver script that runs and tests user code (to-be-created)
* `Solution.x`: The file containing the user code
* `...`: Anything else we might need
