### temp directory

This folder holds the temporary code that users submit. Temporary directories
are auto-generated (e.g. `a94Fjl2flQ/`) and contain the following files:

* `Driver.x`: The driver script that runs and tests user code
* `Solution.x`: The file containing the user code

After a user's code is judged, the temp folder will automatically be deleted.
